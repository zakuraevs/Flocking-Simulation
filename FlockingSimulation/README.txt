Flocking Simulation is a graphical 2d simulation written by Sergey Zakuraev 
as a part of Aalto University Programming 2: Studio course, where a user-selected number of vehicles (boids) move in a life-like flocking manner. Each vehicle has a number of parameters such as a position in the 2d world and a velocity, and each vehicle follows four rules to achieve realistic behavior. The app has been implemented at the difficult level, all the required features have been implemented, along with several additional ones.

In order to run the program, the user needs to have Java SE Development Kit 8 (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and Scala IDE for Eclipse (http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html) installed on their computer. The program can be imported into Eclipse as a git project:

1. Copy the clone URL on GitHub
2. File -> import -> Git -> Projects from Git -> next in Eclipse
3. Clone URI -> finish
4. Follow the recommended settings

The app can be launched by running the FlockSimulationApp.scala class inside the gui package as a Scala Application.
