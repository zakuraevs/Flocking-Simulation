# Flocking-Simulation
A 2D simulation of flocking behavior that allowsusers to add autonomous characters & obstacles, resize the simulation and control parameters such as speed and gravitational pull in real time.

This program is a Scala implementation of Craig Reynold's "Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters" (Reynolds, 1997).
